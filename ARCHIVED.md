I wrote this a decade ago, at time of writing. An eternity in software years. Ironically, it was probably the last time I used SQL in any project, and while this obviously helped, who uses SQL anymore? I don't even know what the landscape looks like for SQL libraries and tools.

It was fun, it filled a gap, it worked for what I needed it to. But it never really took off, and I will absolutely never come back to it. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
